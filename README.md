# airflow-demo

Local development environment for Airflow utilising Airflow's official docker
images.

## Dependencies

This project is intended to be run within a Unix OS or WSL2, this is not 
by desire but by necessity as most of Airflow's documentation assumes a Unix
based operating system.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Usage

Ensure that you have docker running and that it is accessible from your terminal.

Run `make init` which will initialise the Airflow docker containers.

Run `make run` to start the project, which will spawn an airflow web server
at http://localhost:8080.

## Development

Dags you're developing should be kept in the `dags/` folder as these will be
mounted to the Airflow docker containers.

## Purpose

The intention for this project is to serve as a quick way to initialise Airflow
and develop pipelines locally, without having to connect to cloud compute or 
storage. Agile development requires quick development loops, making changes to
code and being able to immediately see the results is critical. This is not possible
if you're required to run even development workloads remotely.

Ideally, this repository should have guidance for seamless local development through
to production deployments, but at the moment I'm just working out how to get local
development working.

Eventually I intend to make use of environment variables
to determine if the user is running on local or remote compute, and seamlessly transition
any connection strings to make use of cloud resources. This will require some level
of intentionality on the part of the developer, ensuring data sources and compute
connection strings are parameterised, however I have not explored this idea further.
It's clear how to do this using a tool like Dagster, but I have not yet seen an example
for Airflow.
